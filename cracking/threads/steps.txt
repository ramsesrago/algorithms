Threads
Threads facts:
Threads share the heap (memoria dinamica, malloc(), new )
but not the stack (variables, cosas en una funcion, estatica, arreglos, matrices)

- Pointers, Function pointers, function arguments, stack, heap
- Create a couple of threads and print something from the threads (don't use join)
- Set thread names and Print thread id's and names of the threads from the threads context
